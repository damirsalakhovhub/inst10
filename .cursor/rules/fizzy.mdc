description: Using basecamp/fizzy as a reference project.

Reference project
- basecamp/fizzy (https://github.com/basecamp/fizzy)
- Local clone: `/Users/damirsalakhov/Work/fizzy-reference`

Purpose
- Learn patterns and engineering decisions (architecture, Rails conventions, UI flows).
- Look for good solutions and get inspired by their implementation approaches.
- You can copy code verbatim or port features 1:1. 
- When implementing new features or making architectural decisions, check Fizzy for reference patterns.


How to use Fizzy (workflow)
- Default: follow this repo’s conventions first.
- Use Fizzy only when implementing a NEW subsystem or a design choice is unclear.
  Examples: kanban board behavior, card lifecycle, attachments/viewers, background jobs, routing conventions.

When referencing
- Provide a short “pattern summary” in plain English.
- Link to the exact Fizzy file(s) and commit/tag being referenced.
- Extract principles, not code.

Architecture guidance (example)
- Prefer RESTful CRUD resources; if an action does not map cleanly, model it as a new resource. (This matches Fizzy’s own style guidance.) 

Output expectations
- After referencing: list what you adopted (principle), what you rejected, and why.
