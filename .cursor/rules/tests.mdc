description: Testing + Git rules: run relevant tests, report status, never commit/deploy unless asked.

Testing
- After code changes, run relevant tests (fastest meaningful subset).
- Only claim completion after tests pass.
- If tests fail: attempt one fix iteration; if still failing or unclear, stop and report findings + next steps.

Git / deploy
- Do not commit unless explicitly asked.
- Do not deploy unless explicitly asked.
