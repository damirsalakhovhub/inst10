description: Testing + Git rules: run relevant tests, report status, never commit/deploy unless asked.

Testing
- After code changes, run relevant tests (fastest meaningful subset).
- Only claim completion after tests pass.
- If tests fail: attempt one fix iteration; if still failing or unclear, stop and report findings + next steps.

Git / deploy
- **NEVER** commit unless the user explicitly requests it.
- **NEVER** deploy unless the user explicitly requests it.
- If the user says "commit" or "коммит" as part of a multi-step task, commit ONLY that specific step, not subsequent work.
- After making file changes, do NOT automatically commit — wait for explicit instruction.
