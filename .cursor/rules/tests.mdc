description: Testing + Git rules: run relevant tests, report status, never commit/deploy unless asked.

Testing
- After code changes, run relevant tests (fastest meaningful subset).
- Only claim completion after tests pass.
- If tests fail: attempt one fix iteration; if still failing or unclear, stop and report findings + next steps.

Git / deploy
- **NEVER** commit unless the user explicitly requests it.
- **NEVER** deploy unless the user explicitly requests it.
- **CRITICAL: Commits reset color highlighting of changes in IDE, making it hard to review what was added.**
- **If the user says "commit" or "коммит" as part of a multi-step task:**
  - Do NOT commit immediately after making changes
  - Wait until ALL changes are complete and user has reviewed them
  - Only commit when user explicitly confirms they are ready
- After making file changes, do NOT automatically commit — wait for explicit instruction.
- Even if "commit" appears in task list, treat it as a reminder, not immediate action — wait for explicit confirmation.
