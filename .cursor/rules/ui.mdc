UI & styling
- Do not invent layout or UX flows that were not requested.
- Do not invent content or hardcode fake data.
- UI text/copy must be in English.
- If the design system already has a component (e.g., button, input, link), reuse it. Do not create new ad-hoc elements instead of existing UI kit components.

CSS/SCSS rules
- No inline styles unless explicitly requested.
- Prefer existing design system / utility classes / shared styles used in the repo.
- **Use SCSS nesting features:**
  - Use `&` parent selector for BEM-like class names (e.g., `.component { &-child { } }` → `.component-child`)
  - Nest related selectors within parent blocks for better organization
  - Keep nesting depth reasonable (max 3-4 levels)
  - Use nesting for pseudo-classes (`&:hover`, `&:focus`) and modifiers

Animation timing functions
- Default: use `linear` timing function for all animations and transitions.
- Use `ease-in-out` or `ease-out` only for movement/resizing of large UI elements (modals, panels, page transitions).

UI robustness
- Avoid fragile selectors; prefer stable data attributes (e.g., data-testid).
- Keep UI changes minimal and consistent with existing patterns.
