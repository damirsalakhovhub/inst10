UI & styling
- Do not invent layout or UX flows that were not requested.
- Do not invent content or hardcode fake data.
- UI text/copy must be in English.

CSS rules
- No inline styles unless explicitly requested.
- Prefer existing design system / utility classes / shared styles used in the repo.

UI robustness
- Avoid fragile selectors; prefer stable data attributes (e.g., data-testid).
- Keep UI changes minimal and consistent with existing patterns.
